openscience can enhance climatechange research. @ttai and I make the case that adopting open tools will improve research quality and its real-world impact. [Paper link]

1/ climate change research requires collaborations between physical, natural & social scientists (and their data). open tools *already exist* (@Github, @RStudio) which make collaborations more effective (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160.pdf)

2/ research often paywalled in developing countries vulnerable to climate changes, limiting local adapation efforts (https://marxiv.org/hv4da). #Openaccess studies can be accessed by *all* public, stakeholders, policymakers, academics (and funders could pay)

3/ public discourse on climate change issues will also benefit from OS (https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2997.pdf) - we used @altmetric data to show that #openaccess research is more widely communicated online [FIGURE]

4/ climate change is rapid and impacts may be unexpected. Open data sharing (e.g. @CoralReefWatch), use of #preprint servers (@arxiv, @PeerJPreprints), active dissemination to stakeholders (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2016.00128/full) are essential for triage research with societal impact

5/ AND it's never been easier to start working openly. Where to start? https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/ES14-00402.1, http://ohi-science.org/news/importance-of-open-data-science-tools, https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800
