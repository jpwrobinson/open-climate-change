In your application, you had asked, "Are all of Altmetric's sources equally reliable?" While we have some information about how we gather data from each source available on our Knowledge Base, it might also be helpful for you to watch [this recording of a recent community call](https://youtu.be/cPfv-duKGDQ?t=15m36s), where I describe the data we collect and how the collection mechanism differs for policy, syllabi, and news mentions.

From the date of this email, you will have access to Altmetric’s data for 6 months. We will email you at least a week in advance of the end of your term, so you won’t get data access shut off without prior warning.

Thanks for your interest in Altmetric’s data! We look forward to learning what you uncover--please send us your results when ready.
